How to Compile and run:
Run the Game.java program with all the other classes (Board.java, Piece.java, Fen.java, Pawn.java,
Bishop.java, Knight.java, Queen.java, and Rook.java) all in one source folder.
Use the terminal to begin playing the game. The game will alternate between white first and then
black turn. This is not a single player game unless you have an imaginary friend. Please have a friend
play with you. Best of Luck.
